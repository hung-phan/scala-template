This is a simple example application showing how you can integrate a Play project with a Scala.js project.

The application contains three directories:
* `server` Play application (server side)
* `client` Scala.js application (client side)
* `shared` Scala code that you want to share between the server and the client

## Run the application
```shell
$ sbt
> run
$ cd server/js-frontend && yarn run dev
```

## Features

The application uses the [sbt-web-scalajs](https://github.com/vmunier/sbt-web-scalajs) sbt plugin and the [scalajs-scripts](https://github.com/vmunier/scalajs-scripts) library.

- Run your application like a regular Play app
  - `compile` triggers the Scala.js fastOptJS command
  - `run` triggers the Scala.js fastOptJS command on page refresh
  - `~compile`, `~run`, continuous compilation is also available
- Compilation errors from the Scala.js projects are also displayed in the browser
- Production archives (e.g. using `stage`, `dist`) contain the optimised javascript
- Source maps
  - Open your browser dev tool to set breakpoints or to see the guilty line of code when an exception is thrown
  - Source Maps is _disabled in production_ by default to prevent your users from seeing the source files. But it can easily be enabled in production too by setting `emitSourceMaps in fullOptJS := true` in the Scala.js projects.

## Cleaning

The root project aggregates all the other projects by default.
Use this root project, called `scala-template`, to clean all the projects at once.
```shell
$ sbt
> scala-template/clean
```
